## Comments
This assignment was challenging, but I was able to get through it by reading a lot online. The lecture was only moderately helpful. I think I would have enjoyed this assignment more if it was broken down into fewer assignments to check for understanding and mastery of the concepts, rather than trying to apply it all on one assignment.
